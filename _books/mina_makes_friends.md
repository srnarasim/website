Mina Makes Friends
==================

This book is about a clown fish that goes exploring to make new friends.
My target audience are children between the ages of 2 and 8 years who can 
identify themselves with the clown fish and learn and enjoy how the clown 
fish explores the ocean and makes friends.
This book can be used by parents and educators to discuss the topic of moving, 
being a new kid in the class, be curious and venture out.
